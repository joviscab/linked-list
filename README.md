# Odin Project - Linked List

## Who am I? What is this?

Hello, my name is Joviscab and this is part of my learning to code journey!

This project is called Linked List and is part of the Javascript Course of The Odin Project. The idea of this exercise is to put to practice all the Data Structure knowledge that I have acquired until now.

## Skills

With this exercise my idea is to check the Data Structure skills that I have learned until now, as well as using it as an exercise to remember all the lessons until this point.

## If you are reading this

Thank you for your interest! I do not like Data Structure...but here we go...
